            <p>Sushi is a <strong>traditional Japanese dish</strong> of prepared rice, accompanied by a variety of ingredients, such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2/3 cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                    <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
                    <li>4 sheets <em>nori</em> seaweed sheets</li>
                    <li>1/2 cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons picked ginger</li>
                    <li>1 avocado</li>
                    <li>1/2 pound imitation crabmeat, flaked</li>
                </ul>

            <h3> Preparation</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a medium saucepan, bring 1 1/3 cups water to a boil. Add rice, and stir. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. In a small bowl, mix the rice vinegar, sugar ,and salt. Blend the mixture into the rice.</li>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). On a medium baking sheet, heat nori in the preheated oven 1 to 2 minutes, until warm.</li>
                    <li>Center one sheet nori on a bamboo sushi mat. Wet your hands. Using your hands, spread a thin layer of rice on the sheet of nori, and press into a thin layer. Arrange 1/4 of the cucumber, ginger, avocado, and imitation crabmeat in a line down the center of the rice. Lift the end of the mat, and gently roll it over the ingredients, pressing gently. Roll it forward to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
                    <li>Cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices using a wet, sharp knife.</li>
                </ol>
